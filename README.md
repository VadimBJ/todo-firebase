### **To Do List** *is an application that helps users manage their tasks and organize them in a convenient list. It provides an intuitive interface that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks based on their status.*

### *Key features of the To Do List application include:*

+ *Task Addition: Users can add new tasks to the list.*

+ *Task Editing: Users can modify existing tasks.*

+ *Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks from the list.*

+ *Task Status Modification: Users can mark a task as "Done" or change it back to the "Active" state by simply clicking on the task text.*
