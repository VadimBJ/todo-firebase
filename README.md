**To Do List** *is an application that helps users manage their tasks and organize them in a convenient list. It provides an intuitive interface that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks based on their status.*

*The application offers two implementations of the To Do List:*

*1. Using Redux:*
+ *Adding tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.*
+ *Editing tasks: Users can modify existing tasks.*
+ *Deleting tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.*
+ *Changing task status: Users can mark a task as "Done" or revert it back to the "Active" state by simply clicking on the task text.*
+ *Filtering tasks by status: Users can utilize filters to view tasks based on their status. Filters allow displaying all tasks ("All"), only active tasks ("Active"), or only completed tasks ("Done"). This helps organize and prioritize the task list according to the user's current needs.*
*2. Using Firebase:*
+ *Adding tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.*
+ *Deleting tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.*
+ *In this case, all tasks are stored in a remote database and are preserved even after the application is reloaded.*
